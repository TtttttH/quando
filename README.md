# Quando - Visual Programming for Digital Interactive Exhibits

Quando can currently only be installed locally - please [see these instructions](./docs/install_local.md).

## Using the Quando:Editor

You can open the editor called 'Inventor' from the (small) popup window or by opening [127.0.0.1/inventor](127.0.0.1/inventor) in Chrome browser.

_You may also replace 127.0.0.1 with another PC's IP address or a hostname_

## Using the Quando:Client

After you have deployed scripts, you can open them directly from the (small) popup window or through [127.0.0.1/client](127.0.0.1/client) in Chrome browser, which will load the last script that was opened.  You can right click the screen to choose a different script to load.

### Optional - Leap Motion
To use the Leap Motion, the standard Leap Motion (Orion) software needs to be installed on the Client PC, i.e. where the Leap motion is plugged in and where the browser will be run. The SDK is not needed.

Note: Web Apps must be enabled for using the leap Motion - in Windows, you may need to see [How to keep Leap Motion web apps enabled](https://forums.leapmotion.com/t/allow-web-apps-setting-resets-on-pc-on-computer-restart/8057).
